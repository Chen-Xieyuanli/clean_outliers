# Clean_Outliers
Clean the outliers of the created dataset

# How to run a demo
```sh
$ python clean_outliers.py path/to/the/Dataset
```

# Version Control
## Version 1
- **Status**: At this version, We use the pretrained ResNet with Pytorch to classify each image in the created dataset and keep the class number of each image.
- **TODO**: Using the class numbers, we would like to find out and delete the outliers.
